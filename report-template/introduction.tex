The goal of our Compiler Construction course was to build a full compiler for a toy object-oriented language named Tool targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We have proceeded by first implementing the front-end part which consists of a lexical analyzer, a parser, a name analyzer and a type checker. The back-end part was then written in order to generate Java Bytecode for the JVM from the Abstract Syntax Tree obtained with the front-end.

Our project aims to replace the back-end targeting the JVM with a new one targeting the LLVM platform. LLVM is a fast-developing compiler platform consisting of a architecture-independent intermediate representation (LLVM-IR), optimizers for programs written in LLVM-IR and a set of front-end and back-end compilers working with this intermediate representation. Front-end compilers translate a language to LLVM-IR while back-end go from LLVM-IR to native code (or other languages).
