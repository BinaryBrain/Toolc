One way to enhance our back-end to LLVM-IR would be to make better use of the PHI function. We did not used them much, prefering to use pointers and access memory which is not SSA. This is not considered as a good practice in LLVM-IR.

Another interesting and useful extension would be to implement a garbage collector (mark and sweep or reference counting) to properly do automatic memory management.
